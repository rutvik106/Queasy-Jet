# Queasy-Jet
You have been contacted by the airline “Queasy Jet” who have a new slogan: “The less

you weigh, the less you pay” and are planning to implement a possibly controversial fare

system where the fare paid is based on a passenger’s total weight (passenger plus

luggage). You are to design, code and test part of a simple system using the classes

listed and detailed below which will allow the airline to evaluate this idea. This system

will form the basis for a test under exam conditions during which you will be asked to

modify and extend your system. You must therefore ensure that you design the system

according to the specification below and that the code you write should be neat, correctly

indented and comply with Java style guidelines (as taught during the course). You must

develop and submit your system as a BlueJ project. This work itself is not marked but

the demo (test) will be, so you need to complete it yourself and understand the code so

you can modify it. Please write your last-name, first-name and SRN number at the top of

each class as comment. This must be completed as an individual piece of work –

each student works independently. Do not share your work with others. Your

code may be submitted to a comparison system to test for similarity with other

code.

In order to run and demonstrate your system you will need to add a number of

passengers. This must be done in the BookingAdmin class.
